    "### EDA_02: Bivariate Analysis & Strategic Hypothesis-Driven Investigation\n",
    "##### Project name: Employee Churn Prediction\n",
    "##### Author: Fausto Pucheta Fortin\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview:**\n",
    "This notebook focuses on understanding the factors influencing employee turnover by performing bivariate analysis and hypothesis-driven investigation. Key steps include examining the relationships between the target variable (left) and key features, identifying significant patterns, and highlighting actionable insights for model feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach**: Application of statistical tests and insights visualization to uncover turnover patterns, considering both individual features and feature interactions that impact turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tasks:**\n",
    "#### 1. Exploration of Relationships Between Key Continuous Features and Turnover\n",
    "Objective: To analyze how numerical features (e.g., satisfaction level, last evaluation score, number of projects, monthly hours, and time spent at the company) correlate with Left.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Satisfaction Level vs. Left:** Visualized distributions of satisfaction levels among employees who stayed versus those who left. Focus on identifying threshold ranges that may signal increased turnover risk.\n",
    "- **Last Evaluation vs. Left:** Assessed last evaluation scores across turnover groups, identifying any indication of under- or over-performance that correlates with attrition.\n",
    "- **Number of Projects vs. Left:** Analyzed the average and distribution of project counts for retained and departed employees to determine if workload intensity influences Left.\n",
    "- **Average Monthly Hours vs. Left:** Evaluated if excessive hours or low engagement (in terms of monthly hours) are associated with Left, using distribution and central tendency metrics.\n",
    "- **Time Spent at Company vs. Left:** Investigated tenure patterns to understand if employees are more likely to leave at specific milestones (e.g., 1, 3, or 5 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Analysis of Categorical Features and Their Association with Turnover\n",
    "Objective: To assess categorical factors, such as work accident incidence, promotions, department, and salary level, and their contribution to turnover likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Work Accident and Turnover:** Analyzed turnover rates within work accident categories (accidents vs. no accidents) to see if safety incidents influence departure decisions.\n",
    "- **Promotion in Last 5 Years vs. Turnover:** Compared turnover rates between those who received recent promotions and those who did not, hypothesizing that lack of advancement could drive turnover.\n",
    "- **Department vs. Turnover:** Assessed department-wise turnover rates to uncover specific functional areas (e.g., sales, technical) with higher attrition, which could signal department-specific issues.\n",
    "- **Salary Level vs. Turnover:** Evaluated turnover distribution across salary levels (low, medium, high) to identify if compensation tiers affect employee retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Correlation Analysis of Continuous Features\n",
    "Objective: To understand the interrelationships among continuous features and their potential collective influence on turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships among continuous variables, such as satisfaction level, last evaluation score, average monthly hours, and tenure.\n",
    "- Focused on identifying high or moderate correlations that could affect turnover jointly, such as the relationship between monthly hours and evaluation scores or satisfaction levels and number of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Hypothesis Testing for Significant Differences Between Groups\n",
    "Objective: To conduct statistical tests that quantify differences between turnover groups across various features, ensuring results are statistically valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-tests for Continuous Variables:** Conducted t-tests (or Mann-Whitney U tests where distributions were non-normal) on continuous features (e.g., satisfaction level, monthly hours) to confirm if observed differences between groups (stayed vs. left) are statistically significant.\n",
    "- **Cohen's d for Effect Size:** Calculated Cohenâ€™s d for each continuous variable where t-tests indicated statistically significant differences. This step allowed quantifying the magnitude of the differences between groups, with thresholds (e.g., 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large) to assess whether observed differences were practically relevant.\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Test for Categorical Variables:** Performed chi-square tests on categorical features like work accident, department, and salary level, determining the strength of association with turnover.\n",
    "- **ANOVA for Categorical Variables with Multiple Categories:** Applied ANOVA where appropriate to assess differences in turnover across departments, with post-hoc tests to pinpoint specific department differences if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Interaction Analysis of Key Features Related to Turnover\n",
    "Objective: To explore multi-dimensional relationships that might reveal more nuanced turnover drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Satisfaction Level & Salary Level:** Analyzed turnover within combinations of satisfaction and salary levels to check for patterns that indicate if dissatisfaction is heightened at certain salary tiers.\n",
    "**Number of Projects & Average Monthly Hours:** Explored turnover across combinations of project count and monthly hours to assess if workload and effort level jointly influence turnover risk.\n",
    "**Tenure and Satisfaction Level:** Examined combinations of tenure and satisfaction levels to determine if new versus longer-tenured employees display different satisfaction-to-turnover patterns.\n",
    "\n",
